# React Typescript Challenge

Here we have a working calculator react app. Your challenge is to:

1. Convert all class components to function components.
1. Convert it to typescript. The configuration has been done for you. Your job
   is to change each `.js` file to `.ts(x?)` and fill out any missing types. The
   goal is to have an app with total type safety. React propTypes should be
   switched for typescript types.

## Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Run

```
yarn start
```

## Typescript

To validate typescript types

```
yarn tsc
```

## Test

Before you can complete the challenge you need to run and pass the tests:

```
yarn validate
```
