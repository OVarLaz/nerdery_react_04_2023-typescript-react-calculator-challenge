# React Typescript Challenge

Here we have a working calculator react app. Your challenge is to:

1. Convert all class components to function components.
1. Convert it to typescript. The configuration has been done for you. Your job is to change each `.js` file to `.ts(x?)` and fill out any missing types. The goal is to have an app with total type safety.

## Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Run

```
yarn start
```
